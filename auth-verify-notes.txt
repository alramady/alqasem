Auth verification notes:
- Dashboard loads successfully with existing session cookie (from previous "Prog Muhammed" login)
- The old session still works because the JWT verification in sdk.ts still validates correctly
- The admin login page redirects to dashboard when already authenticated (correct behavior)
- Need to verify: login with new Hobart/15001500 credentials works
- The OAuth removal is working - no OAuth routes are being called
- Dashboard shows all KPI cards, charts, activity logs correctly
- 42 notifications badge visible
